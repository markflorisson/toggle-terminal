# toggle-terminal

Toggle (show/hide) Terminator or another terminal emulator on Linux (X11).

# Dependencies

* `xdotool`
* `x11-utils`

# Install

Put the script in a `bin` folder and attach a keybinding to run the script.
You may need a shell script wrapper for this to work, depending on your
window manager / key bindings.

You can also use this with Konsole or emulators other than Terminator.
